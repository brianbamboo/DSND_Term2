# AirBnb Seattle and Boston Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook containing analysis that I completed on the Kaggle/AirBnb Boston/Seattle datasets as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. It also includes the data files I used in the analysis.

## Installations 
Libraries used in the data analysis include [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [matplotlib/pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html), and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). These are all super well-known Python libraries, and further installation instructions can be found on their respective websites (linked).

## Motivation
The primary motivation for this project was to complete a component of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree. I chose to explore the AirBnb Boston and Seattle datasets and answer the following business/data questions:

#### 1. How does listing availability and price change over the course of the year?

*Why does this matter?* Understanding listing availability and price patterns helps us understand how different markets compare to each other. We could potentially take an understanding of when listing availability is high or low in a particular and run a specific promotion in order to attract attention to this particular market. 

#### 2. How do the number of reviews fluctuate over the course of the year? What are the most common reviewer names? What are the most common adjectives in reviews?

*Why does this matter?* Undersatnding how the number of reviews fluctuate over the course of the year can give us information on how users are interacting with the platform. Monitoring data also helps you catch when number of reviews are decreasing at an undesirable rate, and figure out how to address the problem if necessary. Common reviewer names is more of a fun tidbit, but could be used to create some fun marketing campaigns. The most common adjectives in reviews can also help us learn what reviewers care most about in different markets, which can then be used to make business decisions as well. 

#### 3. What are some of the features most correlated with price?

*Why does this matter?* 

## File descriptions
- data/boston-airbnb-open-data
  - calendar.csv, listings.csv, reviews.csv - These are the three Boston data files used in the analysis, which include information on Boston AirBnB listings, reviews, and calendar/availability.
- data/seattle
  - calendar.csv, listings.csv, reviews.csv - These are the three Seattle data files used in the analysis, which include information on Boston AirBnB listings, reviews, and calendar/availability.
- airbnb_seattle_boston_data_analysis.ipynb - This is the Jupyter notebook containing my analysis.

## Summary of results
Read the notebook for the results! Just kidding. Here's a quick summary to what I found for each question:

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to Kaggle and AirBnB for providing the [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston) and [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle) data I used in this analysis. Thanks to Udacity as well for including this project as a part of their Data Scientist Nanodegree. I got some cool experience with writing my first Github readme in particular, hehe.
